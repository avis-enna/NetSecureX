## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### Elevated Privileges

Some features require elevated privileges:

- **Packet Capture**: Requires root/administrator privileges
- **Raw Sockets**: May require elevated privileges on some systems
- **Network Interfaces**: Access to network interfaces may be restricted

**Recommendation**: Use principle of least privilege and only elevate when necessary.

### Network Scanning Ethics

NetSecureX is designed for legitimate security testing:

- **Authorization Required**: Only scan networks you own or have permission to test
- **Rate Limiting**: Use appropriate delays to avoid overwhelming targets
- **Legal Compliance**: Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities responsibly

### API Key Security

- **Rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys
- **Monitoring**: Monitor API key usage for anomalies
- **Scope Limitation**: Use API keys with minimal required permissions
- **Secure Storage**: Protect configuration files from unauthorized access
